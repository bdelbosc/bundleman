BUGS
----

* bug: if the svn url point to an invalid url with a tags the status is
  already released (use_tag status) instead of invalid.

* bug: bm-bundle --archive A_OLD_TAG
  if there are differents products in the old tag than the wc
  this will raise some errors, should not analyzed products with --archive.

* handles weird cases like bundle with

  - product -r1234 path/product/trunk

    what if product wc is != r1234 ?
    releasing should be done like a tag ?

  - product path/product/trunk

    but the wc is switched to a branch ?

* bug: do not work with svn 1.1x (sarge stable)


FEATURES
--------

* bm-*
   --archive-url for bm-bundle without having wc
   --sign sign an archive
   --archive should create a .md5 file

* bm-product --init should ask to create branches/tags layouts if
  branches or tags are missing.

* bm-bundle

   --merge=RELEASE_TAG
       for each product
       switch to trunk

   --switch=RELEASE_TAG
       for each product switch (!= svn switch from a bundle)

   --clean-branch=RELEASE_TAG -> remove all product branch with the tag

   --archive-directory=DIR
       Directory contained in the generated archive.
       By default the directory in the archive has the same
       name than the archive itself.

* manages bundleman with bundleman ?
